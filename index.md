## The Application

* Imagine that it's 1974. The oil crisis of 1973 has just happened. 
What kind of car should you buy?

* Meanwhile, you've heard a lot about linear regression. What's it useful for?
How can you see a demonstration?

* In a perfect world, you could use a computer to predict a car's gas mileage,
using linear regression to calculate the answer. Well, it's possible.

* There's an application called Mileage Predictor on the Web. 
With this app, you just enter basic information about a car.
Then you immediately get the predicted mileage.

* The application includes extra information for learning more --
a detailed trend graph, and background on the application and its statistics.

## An Example

* Let's consider an example.

* Imagine that you're interested in a car with 6 cylinders, a weight of 3.5 tons, and automatic transmission.

* What gas mileage will this type of car have? 

* A sample screen from the Mileage Predictor shows us the answer.

## The Prediction



 "The predicted gas mileage of your car is **19** MPG."
